# Hardware Configuration

## Pin assignments

GPIO pin assignments and build counts (number of profiles, select LEDs, and action buttons)
are set in `builder_config.h`, one file per hardware target:

```
lib/hardware/esp32/include/builder_config.h     ← edit this for ESP32
lib/hardware/nrf52840/include/builder_config.h  ← edit this for nRF52840
```

Open the file for your board, change the `CONF_*` values to match your wiring, and rebuild.
The file contains plain-English `static_assert` checks — if your configuration is invalid,
the build fails with a descriptive message telling you exactly what to fix.

For the default wiring table, see [BUILD_GUIDE.md](BUILD_GUIDE.md).

### `ledPower` — firmware-controlled status indicator

Despite the name, `ledPower` is the pin the firmware drives for visible
status signals: the boot-time hardware-mismatch halt, the DelayedAction
countdown, and the config-load-error fallback. It is **not** the pin that
indicates "the board is powered" — that role is covered by the dev board's
hardwired red power LED (always on whenever USB or Vin is supplied).

The default config maps `ledPower` to **GPIO 2** because every common
NodeMCU-style ESP32 dev board (DOIT DevKit V1, Joy-IT SBC-NodeMCU-ESP32,
HiLetgo, etc.) carries an onboard blue LED on that pin, wired LED-to-ground.
That arrangement gives builders a firmware-controlled visual channel
without any external wiring. The strapping-pin caveats in the next section
apply.

If a future build attaches an external panel "status" LED, point `ledPower`
at the corresponding GPIO (any non-strapping pin from the safe list below).

### Pin selection notes — ESP32 strapping pins

GPIOs **0, 2, 5, 12, and 15** are *strapping pins* on the ESP32: their voltage at the moment
of reset selects boot mode, flash voltage, and JTAG behavior. After reset they work like any
other GPIO, but anything wired to them must not pull them HIGH at reset, or flashing and
normal boot will break.

Rules of thumb when assigning pins:

- **GPIO 0** — do not reuse; it is the BOOT button.
- **GPIO 2** — most NodeMCU-style dev boards (including Joy-IT SBC-NodeMCU-ESP32) carry an
  onboard blue user LED here, wired LED-to-ground. That arrangement is safe and the pin is
  usable as a firmware-controlled status LED. **Never add an external pull-up** to GPIO 2 —
  it would force the pin HIGH at reset and put the chip into the rarely used SDIO download
  mode every time you tried to flash.
- **GPIO 12, 15** — avoid unless you have measured the flash-voltage and bootloader-logging
  consequences for your specific board.

For new pin assignments, prefer non-strapping pins: 4, 13, 14, 16–19, 21–23, 25–27, 32, 33.

## Profile configuration

Button mappings are stored in `data/profiles.json`. The file is deployed to the device's
LittleFS filesystem during upload.

### File structure

```json
{
  "_doc": "Key reference: docs/builders/KEY_REFERENCE.md",
  "profiles": [
    {
      "name": "Profile Name",
      "buttons": {
        "A": { "type": "ActionType", "name": "Button label", "value": "..." },
        "B": { "type": "ActionType", "name": "Button label", "value": "..." }
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

Buttons are identified by letter (A, B, C, … Z). The number of button entries per profile
should match the number of action buttons wired (`CONF_NUM_BUTTONS` in `builder_config.h`).
The default build uses 4 buttons (A–D); the firmware supports up to 26 (A–Z).

### Action type reference

| Type | Description | Required fields |
|------|-------------|-----------------|
| `SendStringAction` | Types a text string | `value` |
| `SendCharAction` | Sends a single key | `value` (key name) |
| `SendKeyAction` | Sends a USB HID key code | `value` (key name) |
| `SendMediaKeyAction` | Sends a media key | `value` (media key name) |
| `SerialOutputAction` | Writes to serial monitor | `value` |
| `DelayedAction` | Waits, then executes another action | `delayMs`, `action` |

For the full list of valid `value` strings per action type, see
[KEY_REFERENCE.md](KEY_REFERENCE.md).

### DelayedAction

`DelayedAction` runs another action after a delay. The `delayMs` field sets how long to wait in
milliseconds. While the countdown runs, the power LED blinks.

Example — the camera remote delayed shutter:

```json
{
  "type": "DelayedAction",
  "name": "Delayed Shutter",
  "delayMs": 3000,
  "action": { "type": "SendMediaKeyAction", "value": "KEY_VOLUME_UP" }
}
```

Press the button, set down the controller, and the action fires 3 seconds later.

## Profile-select LED encoding

The firmware picks an encoding mode at runtime based on how many profiles and select LEDs
you have wired:

**One-hot mode** (`numProfiles ≤ numSelectLeds`): one LED lights exclusively for each profile.
Profile 1 → LED 1, Profile 2 → LED 2, etc. Easiest to read at a glance.

**Binary mode** (`numProfiles > numSelectLeds`): the 1-based profile number is encoded in
binary across all select LEDs. LED 1 = bit 0 (LSB), LED 2 = bit 1, etc.

The maximum number of profiles your wiring can represent is `2^numSelectLeds − 1`:

| Select LEDs wired | Max profiles |
|-------------------|-------------|
| 1 | 1 |
| 2 | 3 |
| 3 | 7 |
| 4 | 15 |
| 5 | 31 |
| 6 | 63 |

If you set `CONF_NUM_PROFILES` higher than this ceiling, the build will fail with an error
message.

## Editing profiles

1. Edit `data/profiles.json`.
2. If you only changed the config file (no firmware changes): run a filesystem-only upload:

   ```bash
   pio run -e nodemcu-32s --target uploadfs
   ```

3. If you also changed firmware: run the full upload:

   ```bash
   make upload-esp32
   ```

## Fallback behaviour

If the JSON file is missing or invalid on startup, all LEDs blink 5 times and the factory default
configuration loads. Factory defaults are hardcoded in `lib/PedalLogic/src/pedal_config.cpp`.

## Hardware target maturity

| Target | Board | Status |
|--------|-------|--------|
| ESP32 | NodeMCU-32S | Deployed and tested |
| nRF52840 | Adafruit Feather nRF52840 | Implemented, not tested — use at own risk |

## BLE pairing (optional)

By default the pedal advertises **no passkey** (BLE "Just Works" pairing,
matching consumer BT keyboards like the Apple Magic Keyboard or Logitech
MX Keys). Any BLE host in range can bond and write configuration.

This is the right default for a desk pedal: there is no display on the
hardware to show a passkey, and forcing passkey-entry without a display
locks Android/iOS hosts out of the bonding flow (the OS dialog has
nowhere to read the PIN from).

To opt **into** passkey-entry pairing, add a `pairing_pin` field to
`data/config.json` and re-flash the data partition:

```json
{
  …
  "buttonPins": [13, 12, 27, 14],
  "pairing_pin": 12345
}
```

- Value: integer in `0`–`999999` (a 6-digit BLE passkey, zero-padded
  as needed — `12345` is presented to the host as `012345`).
- Absent or `null` → Just Works (the new default).
- The host reads the PIN from this file during setup; the hardware
  itself never displays it.

Re-flash the data partition after editing:

```bash
pio run -e nodemcu-32s --target uploadfs
```

disabled by default) are in
