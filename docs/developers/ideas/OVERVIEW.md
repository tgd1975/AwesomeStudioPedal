# Ideas Overview

**Open: 28** | **Archived: 21**

Ideas are lightweight, qualitative proposals tracked in [`open/`](open/) until they are either converted into structured tasks or archived. Archived ideas are kept for history in [`archived/`](archived/). See [README.md](README.md) for the file-naming convention (one row per IDEA, sub-notes use the `idea-NNN.<sub-slug>.md` form).

| [IDEA-032](open/idea-032-extract-circuits-as-docs-standalone-repo.md) | 🛠️ tooling | Extract the circuits-as-docs system into a standalone public GitHub repository | Lift the Schemdraw-based schematic generator, pre-commit staleness hook, and docs-as-code wiring pattern into a standalone public repo so other hardware projects can document their circuits the same way. |
| [IDEA-033](open/idea-033-shorten-doublepress-window.md) | ⚡ firmware | Shorten double-press window to reduce single-press latency | 300 ms defer on every single-press feels sluggish — find the smallest window that still lets humans double-tap reliably. |
| [IDEA-034](open/idea-034-test-regime-reevaluation.md) | 🛠️ tooling | Test Regime Reevaluation — minimize human-in-the-loop after IDEA-028 | After the IDEA-028 HAL refactoring lands, do a thorough reevaluation of the entire test regime — close gaps, drop deprecated/duplicate tests, and minimize human-in-the-loop coverage (e.g. BLE is now testable headlessly). |
| [IDEA-035](open/idea-035-multi-user-task-docs-as-code.md) | 🛠️ tooling | Multi-User Workflow for Docs-as-Code Task System | How to evolve the docs-as-code task and idea system from "single user, current branch is the truth" to "two or more people working in parallel branches" without losing the things that make the current system pleasant. |
| [IDEA-038](open/idea-038-comprehensive-review-framework.md) | 📖 docs | Comprehensive code & architecture review framework — define the dimensions | Iteratively define what "thorough review" means for this project — clarity, testability, documentation, usefulness, no dead-ends, extendability — into an actionable rubric. |
| [IDEA-042](open/idea-042-one-click-profile-contribution-from-app.md) | 📱 apps | One-click profile contribution from the app to the community profiles repository | A near-frictionless "Share this profile" flow inside the mobile app and web tools that submits a user's profile to the community repo for maintainer review — no Git, no fork, no PR knowledge required. |
| [IDEA-046](open/idea-046-ble-config-cpp-copy-loop-investigation.md) | ⚡ firmware | Investigate the ble_config_service.cpp copy loop — possible build-system smell |  |
| [IDEA-047](open/idea-047-device-resource-arbiter.md) | 🛠️ tooling | Device-resource arbiter for parallel test sessions | Mutual-exclusion lock around scarce hardware (ESP32, nRF52840, Pixel) so two parallel agent sessions can't grab the same device simultaneously, with self-recovery from hangs and crashes. |
| [IDEA-048](open/idea-048-off-the-shelf-pedalboard.md) | 🔧 hardware | Off-the-shelf pedalboard build — 2 pedals from mostly stock components | A 2-pedal board assembled from as many off-the-shelf parts as possible (enclosure, switches, jacks, hardware) — minimise custom fabrication. |
| [IDEA-049](open/idea-049-logo-more-prominent.md) | 📱 apps | Make the logo more prominent across apps and tools | Use the project logo more consistently — especially in the simulator and the config builders, which currently have none. |
| [IDEA-050](open/idea-050-version-auto-memory-via-awesome-task-system.md) | 🛠️ tooling | Version auto-memory via the awesome-task-system mirror pattern | Mirror Claude's auto-memory through awesome-task-system so memory edits become reviewable, versioned commits instead of out-of-repo files. |
