title: Extract the task-and-idea system into a standalone public GitHub repository
description: Lift the docs-as-code task + idea management system out of AwesomeStudioPedal into its own public repo so other small teams can use it and this project can consume it as an installable tool.

## Motivation

The task-and-idea system built here — lightweight idea tracking in `docs/developers/ideas/`,
structured task tracking in `docs/developers/tasks/`, the `housekeep.py` regeneration
pipeline, the generated `OVERVIEW.md` / `EPICS.md` / `KANBAN.md` dashboards, and the
`ts-*` / `task-*` Claude Code skills — has grown into something that probably has value
outside this project. A handful of friends and colleagues on small teams have asked how
it works. The design intent is already captured in IDEA-021 ("Task and Idea System
Concept for Small Teams") and TASK-222 already restructured the code into a standalone
`awesome-task-system` layout inside this repo.

The natural next step is to finish the job: move it to its own public GitHub repo, give
it a README and a license, and make it installable in another project without carrying
any AwesomeStudioPedal-specific assumptions.

## What this would involve (rough, not committed)

- A new public repo — working name `awesome-task-system` (open to alternatives).
- A bootstrap path so another repo can adopt the system in one command (`housekeep.py --init`
  already exists from TASK-218/224; that's probably the install surface).
- A clear split between the *tool* (scripts, skills, templates) and *project content*
  (the actual `tasks/` and `ideas/` directories, which stay in the consuming repo).
- Decide how skills are distributed — vendored into the consuming repo's `.claude/skills/`,
  or loaded from a shared location?
- A proper README explaining the philosophy (two-track: ideas are qualitative,
  tasks are commitments), the workflow, and who it's for (1–5 person teams).
- Some kind of versioning story so AwesomeStudioPedal can pin to a version and upgrade
  deliberately, rather than being broken by a drive-by change in the tool.

## Open questions (for later)

- Does AwesomeStudioPedal become a *consumer* of the extracted repo (git submodule?
  `pip install`? plain copy?), or is the extraction a fork-and-diverge?
- Is the audience broad enough to justify the maintenance cost of a public repo, or is
  this better as a gist / template repo / blog post?
- Naming — "awesome-task-system" collides with the project naming convention here;
  might want something more neutral for the wider world.
- Does it make sense to bundle the idea system and the task system together, or split
  them? They share infrastructure (`housekeep.py`) but are conceptually independent.

## Why this is an idea, not a task

The scope, audience, and even the decision *whether to do this at all* depend on things
that will only be clear later — how stable the system feels after a few more months of
use, whether anyone external actually wants it, whether IDEA-021's concept proves out.
Converting to a task (or epic) when the picture is clearer.
