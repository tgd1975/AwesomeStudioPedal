title: Task Group Improvements
description: Enhance task group organization and visibility in OVERVIEW.md
---

## Details

The current task overview in `OVERVIEW.md` lacks a clear way to see ungrouped tasks and does not provide an index of task groups. This idea proposes improvements to the task group organization and visibility.

### Proposed Changes

1. **Ungrouped Tasks Group**: Add a new task group called "Ungrouped" or "Miscellaneous" that automatically includes all tasks not assigned to any other group. This will make it easier to identify tasks that need to be categorized.

2. **Alphabetical Sorting**: Sort all task groups alphabetically to make it easier to find specific groups.

3. **Group Index**: Add an index at the top of the task groups section that lists all groups along with their open and completed task counts. This will provide a quick overview of the distribution of tasks across groups.

### Example

#### Group Index

| Group Name | Open Tasks | Completed Tasks | Total Tasks |
|-------------|-----------|-----------------|-------------|
| distribution | 2 | 1 | 3 |
| feature_test | 9 | 1 | 10 |
| LongDoublePress | 1 | 7 | 8 |
| Ungrouped | 15 | 59 | 74 |

### Benefits

- **Better Organization**: Tasks are clearly categorized, making it easier to manage and prioritize work.
- **Quick Overview**: The group index provides a snapshot of the task distribution, helping to identify areas that need attention.
- **Easier Navigation**: Alphabetical sorting and clear grouping make it easier to find specific tasks or task groups.
- **Visibility of Ungrouped Tasks**: The Ungrouped section ensures that no tasks are overlooked and encourages categorization.

### Implementation Steps

1. Update the script or tool that generates `OVERVIEW.md` to include an Ungrouped task group.
2. Modify the generation logic to sort task groups alphabetically.
3. Add logic to count open and completed tasks for each group and include this information in a group index table.
4. Test the changes to ensure that the `OVERVIEW.md` file is generated correctly with the new structure.
5. Update any documentation or scripts that reference the task groups to reflect the new organization.
