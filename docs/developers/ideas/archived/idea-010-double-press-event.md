## Details

Add support for double press events to enable quick successive button presses for additional functionality.

## Resolution

Fully implemented across the entire stack — hardware detection (300ms configurable window,
single-press suppression), `EventDispatcher`, profile/JSON config, `main.cpp` loop,
Flutter app UI (`DoublePressSlot`), and unit tests. nRF52840 remains a stub.
