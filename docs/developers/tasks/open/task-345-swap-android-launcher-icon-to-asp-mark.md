## Description

The Flutter Android app currently ships with the generic Flutter launcher icon
across all `mipmap-*` density buckets. Replace it with the ASP monogram (the
design system's designated app-icon variant — the full mark is reserved for
larger header use) so the app icon on the device home screen, app drawer, and
recents matches the rest of the project surfaces.

This is heavier than the other LogoBranding tasks because it requires
generating five PNG densities (mdpi/hdpi/xhdpi/xxhdpi/xxxhdpi) plus an adaptive
icon (foreground + background layers) for Android 8+, and verifying the result
on a real device.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] `asp-monogram.svg` (per design guide, the app-icon variant — see Notes) rasterised to all required Android densities, replacing `app/android/app/src/main/res/mipmap-*/ic_launcher.png`
- [ ] Adaptive icon (foreground + background) added under `mipmap-anydpi-v26/` so Android 8+ renders correctly with system-shaped masks
- [ ] App rebuilt and installed on the Pixel; launcher, app drawer, and recents all show the ASP monogram
- [ ] iOS icon untouched (out of scope — separate task if/when iOS ships)

## Test Plan

No automated tests required — change is non-functional (asset swap).

Manual verification on the connected Pixel via `/verify-on-device`:

- Reinstall the app, confirm the launcher icon on the home screen and app drawer is the ASP mark
- Open the app and confirm Recents shows the ASP mark
- Long-press the icon and confirm the adaptive-icon variants (squircle, circle, square) all render without clipping the mark

## Notes

- Recommended tool: `flutter_launcher_icons` package — drives the rasterisation from a single source and updates `pubspec.yaml`. Verify it's available before scripting; if not, ask.
- **Design conformance is the law.** The asset for compact / app-icon use is [`docs/design/handoff/logo/asp-monogram.svg`](../../../../docs/design/handoff/logo/asp-monogram.svg) — explicitly called out in the handoff README as the app-icon variant — *not* `asp-mark.svg`, which is the larger header mark. Use the monogram verbatim — no redraw, recolour, or simplification (handoff README non-negotiable #6). The adaptive-icon background colour should come from [`docs/design/handoff/tokens.css`](../../../../docs/design/handoff/tokens.css) (and is shown in [`docs/design/ASP-design-review.html`](../../../../docs/design/ASP-design-review.html) under the brand identity sheet); if the design review does not show the launcher treatment unambiguously, ask before guessing. See EPIC-024 "Design authority" for the full rule set.
- iOS asset catalogue is **not** in scope — a follow-up task can add iOS once that target is active.
