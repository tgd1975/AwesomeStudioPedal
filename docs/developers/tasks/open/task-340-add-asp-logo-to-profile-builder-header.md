## Description

The profile builder at `docs/tools/config-builder/` currently has a text-only
`.asp-header`. Add the canonical ASP mark (`asp-mark.svg`) next to the `<h1>`
title, linked back to the GitHub repo root. Also generate and reference a
`favicon.ico`.

Per IDEA-049 decisions: copy the SVG into the tool's directory.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] `asp-mark.svg` copied to `docs/tools/config-builder/` and rendered to the left of the `<h1>` title
- [ ] Logo wrapped in an `<a href="https://github.com/...">` linking to the repo root
- [ ] `favicon.ico` generated and referenced via `<link rel="icon">`
- [ ] No layout shift versus current header — logo height matches the H1 line-height

## Test Plan

No automated tests required — change is non-functional (static markup + asset).

Manual verification: open the profile builder in a browser, confirm the mark
renders, favicon shows, and the link works.

## Notes

- Shared header CSS lives in [docs/tools/asp.css](docs/tools/asp.css) (`.asp-header`). Editing the shared rule may also affect TASK-341 (configuration builder); coordinate or duplicate per-tool selectors as needed.
- Asset source: `docs/design/handoff/logo/asp-mark.svg`.
