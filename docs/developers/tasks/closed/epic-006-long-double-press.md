# Long-press and double-press detection

Implement long-press and double-press event detection across the full stack:
firmware detection logic, EventDispatcher multi-event API, config schema
extension, main.cpp wiring, simulator support, profile configurator fields,
Flutter UI slots, and host tests. One on-device integration test for the ESP32
(TASK-109) remains open. Seeded by IDEA-009 (Long Press Event) and IDEA-010
(Double Press Event).
