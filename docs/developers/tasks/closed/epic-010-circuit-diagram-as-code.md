# Circuit diagrams as code (Schemdraw)

Replace the Fritzing-exported schematic PNGs with Python-generated SVGs using
Schemdraw. Covers toolchain installation, ESP32 and nRF52840 schematic scripts,
pre-commit hook, CI staleness guard, builder documentation update, and WireViz
artefact removal. Part of the broader wiring-as-code initiative seeded by
IDEA-019 (Wiring as Code); this epic covers the circuit schematic half after
the WireViz harness-diagram approach was retired.
