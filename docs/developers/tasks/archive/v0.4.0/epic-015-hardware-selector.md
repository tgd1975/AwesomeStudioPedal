# Hardware-aware configuration

Add a hardware field to config.json and propagate it through the full stack:
config schema, firmware boot-time mismatch rejection, CLI upload guard, Flutter
app hardware-aware editing and upload guard, and configuration builder hardware
selector with per-board defaults and pinout diagram. Aligns with the
multi-hardware support direction of IDEA-003 (Additional Hardware Support).
