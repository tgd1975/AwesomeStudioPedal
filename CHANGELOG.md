## [Unreleased]

---

## [v0.4.1] — 2026-04-29

### Changed

**Architecture**

- Hardware Abstraction Layer (EPIC-020): replaced `#ifdef` platform soup
  with a `PedalApp` class hierarchy — `Esp32PedalApp`, `Nrf52840PedalApp`,
  `HostPedalApp`, plus a shared `BlePedalApp` layer
- `IFileSystem` dependency injection — filesystem access no longer wired
  through `HOST_TEST_BUILD` guards
- Per-target source layout: `src/esp32/` and `src/nrf52840/` collapsed
  from `lib/hardware/*`; `include/` and `src/` mirror each other under
  every target
- Host promoted to a first-class platform with end-to-end loop tests
- Entry points reorganised into per-target subfolders

**Task system**

- `awesome-task-system/` is now the canonical source; live copies under
  `scripts/`, `.claude/skills/`, and `docs/developers/task-system.yaml`
  are generated artefacts kept in sync via `scripts/sync_task_system.py`
  (enforced by pre-commit)
- Project-level env vars via direnv (`$ASP_PIXEL_DEVICE`,
  `$ASP_ESP32_PORT`, `$ASP_NRF52840_PORT`, `$ASP_PEDAL_MAC`) replace
  hand-typed device serials and ports

### Added

**Agent-collaboration skills (EPIC-021)**

- `/status` — bundles branch + last 3 commits + git status into one call
- `/housekeep` — wraps `scripts/housekeep.py --apply` and stages the
  regenerated index files
- `/commit` — encodes the `--no-verify` decision protocol from CLAUDE.md
- `/doc-check` — auto-triggers on `.md` moves to validate persona placement
- `/ble-reset` — disconnect → remove → scan → pair → connect → verify
  recovery sequence for flaky pedal pairing
- `/ui-dump` and `/verify-on-device` — own the `adb shell uiautomator
  dump` loop for driving the Pixel app

### Fixed

- Action Editor value field no longer carries over when the action type
  changes to one with a different value space (TASK-280)
- Validation banner now refreshes immediately after profile edits
  instead of waiting for the profile count to change (TASK-281)

---

## [0.4.0] — 2026-04-28

### Added

- External 10 kΩ pull-up resistors on button pins (documented and wired)
- Architecture diagram set: pipeline/dataflow, static structure, decision flows,
  contributor workflow, slot vocabulary spatial map

**Task System (v2)**

- `epic:` field replaces `group:`; `paused/` folder and `paused` first-class status;
  `active/` folder for in-flight work
- `housekeep.py` central engine — file moves, status derivation, OVERVIEW/EPICS/KANBAN
  regeneration, `--init` setup, `--version`
- `task-system.yaml` configuration

- `app/.flutter-version` pins Flutter outside the devcontainer
- `verify-on-device` skill — drives the Flutter app via adb for feature tests
- Android emulator setup guide
- Repo restructure: `app/` directory; ideas folder split into `open/` + `archived/`

**Testing**

- E2E feature tests for CLI (validate, scan, upload, upload-config) and Flutter app
  (home/BLE, profile list, action editor, upload preview, end-to-end workflows)
- On-device multi-press integration test (ESP32)
- BLE config integration tests (host + on-device)
- Usability session protocol for Action Editor

### Fixed

- Schema defect — action `value` / `pin` fields were not required
- Stale libdeps cache for local hardware libs in test environments
- ESP32 / nRF52840 firmware build breakages
- Power LED was hardwired to VCC, hiding firmware error signals (now driven by GPIO 2)

### Changed

## [0.2.0] — 2026-04-10

### Added

**Firmware**

- JSON-based configuration system: `ConfigLoader` reads/writes `data/pedal_config.json` from LittleFS; button mappings are now external and editable without recompiling
- `Profile` class — dedicated abstraction for per-profile action storage and naming
- Action hierarchy: `SerialOutputAction`, `NonSendAction` base class, `DelayedAction` wrapper; each in its own source file
- LittleFS filesystem support with custom partition table giving 1.5 MB storage
- `data/pedal_config.json` — default on-device configuration deployed via `pio run --target uploadfs`
- ArduinoJson library dependency for JSON parsing and serialisation
- Profile description support — profiles carry a human-readable name field
- `ProfileManager::resetToFirstProfile()` — wired into config reload path
- 7-profile system with binary LED encoding across 3 select LEDs
- `DelayedAction` — lets solo performers trigger a command and step into position before it fires
- `EventDispatcher` — centralised, decoupled event handling for button presses
- `Send` class hierarchy: `SendChar`, `SendString`, `SendKey`, `SendMediaKey`
- `pedal_config.cpp` — button mappings moved out of `main.cpp` into `PedalLogic`
- Smart pointer usage throughout — no raw `new`/`delete`

**Hardware support**

- nRF52840 hardware package (`lib/hardware/nrf52840`) with `Button`, `LEDController`, `ButtonController`, and `BleKeyboardAdapter`
- `feather-nrf52840` and `feather-nrf52840-test` PlatformIO environments
- `IButton` interface — `Button` now inherits from it, enabling platform-agnostic handling
- `createBleKeyboardAdapter()` factory per hardware package — `main.cpp` is hardware-agnostic
- `ILEDController`, `IButtonController`, `IBleKeyboard` interfaces

**Testing**

- Host unit test infrastructure (GoogleTest + CMake) — all tests run without hardware via `make test-host`
- `ProfileManager`, `EventDispatcher`, `Send`, and `Button` unit tests (125 tests total)
- On-device Unity test suite for button logic with interactive prompts and countdown output
- Pre-commit hook running markdownlint and the full host test suite

**Build & tooling**
